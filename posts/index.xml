			<description>Hello! It&amp;rsquo;s been an exact year since the first post on this blog! Time really goes by, I had plans to update this blog but got busy apparently. A lot has happened in this year, I got a new job, in a new city! I&amp;rsquo;m not one for traveling often, so I always appreciate a change of scenery :) I also got really interested in quantum physics and string theory, but turns out I need to learn a lot of complex analysis, so I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully try to get to that.</description>

<p>I like to end this post with another promise to update this website and add more stuff on the projects and the work I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Take care ðŸ‘‹</p>
