      <description>Hi, It&amp;rsquo;s been an exact year since the first post on this blog! Time really goes by, I had plans to update this blog but got busy apparently. A lot has happened in this year, I got a new job, in a new city! I&amp;rsquo;m not one for traveling often, so I always appreciate a change of scenery :) I also got really interested in quantum physics and string theory, I like the idea of a single equation to explain the universe.</description>
